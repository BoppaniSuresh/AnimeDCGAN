# DCGAN for Anime Image Generation

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating anime images. The model is trained on the Anime Image dataset to generate new anime-style images.

## Dataset
The Anime Image dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset/data). The dataset consists of thousands of anime-style images, which are used to train the DCGAN.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/BoppaniSuresh/AnimeDCGAN.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd AnimeDCGAN

3. Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the DCGAN model

5. Generate new anime images using the trained model


## Results
Sample generated images will be available in the `result.png`.
